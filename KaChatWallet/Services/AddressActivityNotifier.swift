/// "Received" notifications: alerts the user when any of the wallet's own addresses - the main
/// address, spending-chain addresses (Manage Addresses) or watch-only cold-storage addresses -
/// receives Kaspa from someone else. A local notification, plus a persisted per-address balance
/// baseline update so the catch-up path and the open Manage Addresses / Cold Storage screens
/// stay in sync.
///
/// Self-send filtering is the critical part - change from own payments, consolidations,
/// KNS inscription change, cold-storage withdrawals, payments between own addresses, and
/// anything another app on the same seed sends (a KaPosts post, a KaChat message) must NOT
/// notify. A tx counts as ours when ANY of its inputs spends from one of our addresses:
///   1. REST resolve (the classifier's own endpoint, `resolve_previous_outpoints=light`):
///      fetch the tx and check its input addresses.
///   2. The API often leaves a seconds-old tx's input addresses empty, so an unresolved input
///      is matched against the coins our addresses just spent (the `removed` entries of the
///      live batches, by outpoint), then looked up in the tx that created it.
///   3. A tx that can't be read at all is ours when the same batch spent from our addresses.
/// Notifications are deduped per txId (persisted, capped) and multiple outputs of one tx to
/// our addresses notify once with the summed amount.
///
/// Catch-up (app foregrounded after being away) diffs live balances against the persisted
/// baseline; increases are attributed via each address's recent transactions with the same
/// inputs-not-ours filter, falling back to a neutral "Balance increased" notification when
/// resolution fails. First run just seeds the baseline silently so enabling the feature (or
/// importing a wallet) never blasts notifications for historical funds. Only receives newer
/// than the address's floor (the newest block time a catch-up already looked at) count, newest
/// first and no more than the increase - so older history is never announced again.
///
/// With remote push registered, the push service sends "Received" for the same addresses, and
/// the app hides that push only while it is open (`willPresent`). So the app announces a
/// receive itself only while it is open; one that landed while it was away was the push's.
///
/// Gated by Settings > Notifications > "Address Activity" (default ON) plus the master
/// notification mode. Deliberately NOT gated by Simple Mode - Portfolio, Manage Addresses and
/// Cold Storage all remain available there, and these are wallet notifications, not social.
