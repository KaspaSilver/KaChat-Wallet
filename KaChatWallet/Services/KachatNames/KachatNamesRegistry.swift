/// The `.kachat` registry for the screens: lookups, an owner's names, listings, lapsed names,
/// offers, history and identities, from one of two sources -
///
/// - **the names indexer** (KACHAT_NAMES_INDEXER.md Part D) at `AppSettings.indexerURL`, used when
///   that field is set and `GET /names/status` answers 200 for this manifest's registry id;
/// - **the chain walker** otherwise: the registry's live UTXO set (gaps and names, plus the offers
///   this device made) kept from the manifest's genesis gap forward. A refresh asks a node which
///   tracked UTXOs are still unspent, finds each spent one's spending transaction through the
///   Kaspa REST API (`GET /addresses/{p2sh}/full-transactions`), decodes the spend like the
///   indexer does (B3), verifies every new state against its output script and moves on. Cached
///   per network in Application Support.
///
/// Records from either source are only read here; every action re-reads its UTXOs from a node
/// (`KachatNamesService.liveRegistryUtxo`) before it builds anything. Testnet-10 only.
